# verse test

Write a REST API in the language/framework of your choice for a money-transferring application like Verse. It should have the following features:


* An endpoint to get the current balance of a given user.

* An endpoint to make a transfer of money between two users.


## Notes
The API can be used as admin or as regular user. 

- Admin endpoints are available under /admin/* and need an url parameter ?key=foobar. 
- User endpoints require a valid JWT as a url parameter ?jwt={jwttoken}

At startup the application will load some test-data and show some valid jwt for debug.

* Repository pattern, inmemory implementation for now.
* Balance and Amount fields are in cents. (int64)
* JWT middelware to validate and authenticate the user. 

## Api response
- Successfull request will return http status code 200 along with a json with additional information.
- Failed request will return http status code 40X along with a json with additional information of the error.
```
Type (string) Posible values api_error/authentication_error
Code (string) Optional code
Message (string) A string representation for the error
```
